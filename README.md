# Expense Tracker App

This is a project based on [Traversy Media's Expense Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ), but using Typescript and the Context API in a very different way.

The Context API was used following the advice by Kent C Dodds in his [blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

Uses:

- Typescript
- Context API
- Ramda.js
- React Testing Library (unit and integration testing)
- React Hook Form
- Framer Motion
- Tailwind CSS

To install `yarn`.

To run `yarn start`

To run all tests: `yarn run test`

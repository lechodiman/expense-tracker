# Expense Tracker App

This is a project based on [Traversy Media's Expense Tracker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuFDcZABiDQ), but using Typescript and the Context API in a very different way.

The Context API was used following the advice by Kent C Dodds in his [blog post](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively).

I used Ramda js to make the code as functional as possible.
